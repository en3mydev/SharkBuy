# SHARKBUY - A CLOTHING SITE (WEB APPLICATION)
#### Video Demo:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2DC48uqTYg>
#### Description: SharkBuy is a website where you can purchase clothes. 
This project was created solely by me, and it took about 3 weeks to develop. 
On this website, you can create an account, log in, and browse products grouped by gender (men/women) as well as a section for kids. All the products and accounts are stored in a database. 
You can add products to your cart and proceed to checkout where you can place your order. However, it's important to note that the order won't be actually submitted, as I haven't finished that part.
The website is built using Flask, and I incorporated functions such as "apology," "login_required," "login," and "logout" from the CS50 finance problem. There's a list of features that should be added to the website, but I haven't implemented them yet:
-Sorting items by price and newest arrivals
-Implementing a wishlist feature
-Creating a profile menu that allows users to change their passwords and view order history
-Developing individual product pages
I'm aware of how to implement these features, but it would require a significant amount of time. Instead, I plan to allocate my time to learning new programming concepts and skills.
